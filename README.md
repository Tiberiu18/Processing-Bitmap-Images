# Bmp-Images-Parser
This project implements a few functionalities for processing bitmap images.
<br>Available commands are found on folder named **input**. 
<br>**ref** folder has the desired output for the given tests.<br>
There are **2** bugs which I know of.<br>
1 - Task3 -> input3 has a minor error
2 - Task4 -> The algorithm is good, but I presume there is a problem with the height and the width. Can't figure it out yet.
